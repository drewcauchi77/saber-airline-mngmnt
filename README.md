# Airline Management System - KM Malta

### About This Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently working as a Front-End Developer, but I'm diving into the world of .NET and C# as I prepare for my next job. My goal is to sharpen my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills, which were a bit rusty as I originally learned them in Java. So, I decided to create this Airline Management System for KM Malta as a way to refresh my knowledge and get hands-on experience with C#.

### Project Overview

This project is an Airline Management System for KM Malta. It allows users to:

- **View Flights:** You can browse through the list of available flights and see the next one thatâ€™s scheduled.
- **Book Flights:** Itâ€™s possible to book a flight and view your existing bookings.

I've tried to incorporate as many OOP principles as possible to make this project a solid example of what I've learned and what Iâ€™m continuing to refine.

### Features Implemented

- **File I/O:** The system reads from and writes data to files, ensuring persistence of bookings and flight data.
- **Domain Management:** The project is organized into directories that correspond to different domains of the system, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction:** Core OOP principles are applied throughout the project, with a focus on making the system flexible and maintainable.
- **Enums:** Enums are used to represent fixed sets of constants, like flight statuses or booking categories.
- **Contracts:** Interfaces and contracts are used to define the expected behaviors in various parts of the system.
- **Static Classes:** I've used static classes where appropriate to manage data and methods that don't require instance-based logic.

### What's Next?

There are a few areas I would improve next on the system:

- **Error Handling:** I need to tighten up the error handling, particularly around booking creation, to ensure the system is robust against bad input or unexpected situations.
- **Pagination:** As the list of flights grows, it would be beneficial to implement pagination to keep the user interface manageable and responsive.
- **Seat Availability:** Implementing seat availability is on my to-do list to make the booking system more realistic and functional.
- **Access Rights for Agents:** Iâ€™m also considering introducing a tiered access rights system for agents, allowing different levels of access based on roles.
